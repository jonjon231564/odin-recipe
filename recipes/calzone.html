    <h3>Calzone recipe</h3>
    <p>
        Calzones are an Italian folded pizza, stuffed with various ingredients, and baked to golden perfection. They are typically filled with cheeses, meats, and vegetables, offering a wide range of flavors and textures. Making calzones at home is a fun and creative process, allowing you to personalize the fillings to match your tastes. This recipe includes a classic combination of cheeses and Italian sausage, wrapped in a homemade dough that's tender and flavorful.

        Start by preparing the dough, allowing it time to rise. While it's resting, mix together the filling ingredients, adjusting the flavors as you like. Once the dough is ready, divide it into portions and roll each one into a circle. Place a generous spoonful of filling onto one half of each circle, then fold the dough over, sealing the edges to create a half-moon shape. Brush with egg wash and bake until golden brown. Serve your calzones hot, with marinara sauce for dipping, for a comforting and satisfying meal that's sure to please.
