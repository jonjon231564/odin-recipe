    <h3>Cheese Burger</h3>
    <p class="description">
        The cheeseburger is an iconic American dish that can be found in diners and restaurants across the country. With its juicy beef patty, melted cheese, and fresh toppings, it's a beloved comfort food for many. This recipe captures the essence of a classic cheeseburger, combining seasoned ground beef with the perfect selection of condiments and vegetables. Whether cooked on the grill or stovetop, the cheeseburger can be customized with your favorite ingredients to make it uniquely yours.

    </p>
    <p class="instructions">
        Begin by seasoning the beef patty with salt and pepper, then cook to your desired level of doneness on a grill or stovetop skillet. As the meat nears completion, place the cheese on top to allow it to melt slightly. While the patty cooks, prepare the bun by spreading mayonnaise, ketchup, and mustard on the inside, then layering with lettuce, tomato, and pickles. Place the cooked patty with melted cheese on the bottom half of the bun, then close with the top half. Serve your cheeseburger with a side of fries, onion rings, or a refreshing salad for the perfect meal.
